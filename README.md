## 🎯 About the Repository
This project is my personal documentation of MySirG’s 100 Days Challenge —  
where I’m learning and practicing programming concepts every day.  

- Each day’s work is stored in a **separate folder** (`Day01`, `Day02`, etc.).  
- Every folder includes its **own README** describing that day’s task.  
- This main README only provides an **overview**, not daily updates.
